## Overview

**Uni Mentor** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students with academic queries, resume reviews, project suggestions, PDF summarization, and interview preparation. Built using Python, Hugging Face Transformers, and the Groq API, it delivers fast and accurate responses while handling dynamic user queries. The chatbot interface is developed using Streamlit, making it easy to use and interact with. The project follows a modular structure for better scalability and maintainability.
